# How to Transfer Your EU Registered Vehicle to Donostia, Basque Country, Spain

Hello and welcome to my step-by-step guide
to the unnecessary complicated process of registering an EU vehicle in Donostia, Basque Country.
As a prerequisite, you will need your NIE, residency ("empadronamiento"),
and a Spanish phone number for this.
You need to do the steps in this order, sequentially, as each step requires the last.
For all papers, it's best to bring the originals and 2–3 copies, although they *should* usually make copies themselves.

## Step(s) 0: Prerequisites

- NIE.
- Empadronamiento.
- Spanish phone number.

## Step 1: ITV (Technical Inspection)

Closest to Donostia is ITV Urnieta (https://www.itevelesa.com/es/nuestras-estaciones/itv-urnieta). The online appointments won't work with a foreign license plate number. Call 943550000, press 1 for Euskera (even if you don't speak Euskera), ask there for an appointment for a foreign vehicle. They *should* tell you what you need. But they're not always accurate, so just in case, see below. Note: none of these documents have to be translated into Spanish!

- Passport
- NIE
- Empadronamiento (just in case)
- Home country car registration certificates, e.g., for Germans, part I and II, i.e., the vehicle registration document and the title document.
- EU certificate of conformity (COC). If you don't have one, you can get one made in Donostia. Beware of some dealerships offering this service for a hefty sum. You can get it for free if you find a dealer for the same brand as the make of your car.
- Proof of purchase. I used the contract of purchase. The national tax ID number should be on the invoice, if you bought from a business.
- Warning: you will not get your inspection papers (ficha tecnica) on the same day, you will have to come back in 3–5 days.

Cost: about 110 EUR. Expect to spend at least 2 hours at the ITV on your first appointment, only about 20 minutes on the 2nd.

## Step 2: Registration Tax

There are 2 types of taxes for the transferring your car: registration tax and road tax. You only have to pay the latter! See (https://administracion.gob.es/pag_Home/Tu-espacio-europeo/derechos-obligaciones/ciudadanos/vehiculos/traslado/impuesto.html). For the registration tax, Impuesto de matriculación, make an appointment at the tax office, (https://www.gipuzkoa.eus/es/web/ogasuna), Diputación Foral de Gipuzkoa, located at Errotaburu Pasealekua, 2, 20018 Donostia, Gipuzkoa.

You will need:
- Passport
- NIE
- Empadronamiento
- Home country car papers: reg. certificate parts I and II, COC.
- ITV papers, ficha tecnica.
- Fill out form 030: https://www.gipuzkoa.eus/es/web/ogasuna/impuestos/modelo/030
- Fill out form 565: https://www.gipuzkoa.eus/es/web/ogasuna/impuestos/modelo/565

Cost: 0 EUR. Expect to spend 1 hour at the appointment. You will get the tax exemption on the spot.

## Step 3: Road Tax

Pay the road tax, impuesto de circulacion. Make an appointment here: https://www.donostia.eus/AurreHitzordua/udalinfo/aa14aBusqueda.jsp?lang=es, and go here: Ijentea Kalea, 6, 20003 Donostia, Gipuzkoa.

Cost: varies, roughly 60 EUR for me. Expect to spend about 30 minutes at the appointment, get the proof of payment on the spot.

## Step 4: DGT Online Appointment

Make an appointment at the DGT for matriculacion. The appointments are made online only, here: https://sede.dgt.gob.es/es/otros-tramites/cita-previa/. The system is trash because the appointments are "all out" in 5 minutes after "opening", as if the internet is some kind of finite, precious resource. You can only "click" on the appointment during work hours, but as soon as possible, ideally at 9:00 am. If they're out, try again the next day...

## Step 5: DGT Appointment

On the day of the appointment, you will go here: Julio Caro Baroja Plaza, 2, 20018 Donostia, Gipuzkoa. You need:

- Passport
- NIE
- Empadronamiento
- Home country papers: reg. I and II, COC.
- ITV papers, ficha tecnica.
- Form 565 that you received at the Diputación Foral, point 2.
- Proof of road tax payment, point 3.
- Form Mod-01: https://sede.dgt.gob.es/export/sites/dgt/.galleries/modelos-solicitud/01/Mod.01-ES.pdf

Cost: about 99.77 EUR. Expect to spend an hour at the appointment. You will not get the registration on the spot and will have to come back in a couple of days, without an appointment. Beware, once you pick up your registration papers, you will have to give them the originals of your car papers from the home country. If you need these to deregister your car at home, make necessary preparations beforehand.

## Step 6: Car Insurance

As soon as you get the registration papers and your license plate numbers, get a car insurance. Ideally, do this before you change your plates. You can compare insurances here: https://www.acierto.com/a/comparador-seguros-coche.php?a=4406&b=acierto&c=s&d=569689562330&e=&n=xub&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw1K-zBhBIEiwAWeCOF1ZBmvx9UqUbxZIQ6ESuFiK8RVXEJD2JhcwOy6vSbMlBzLB4-aCHDxoCZR0QAvD_BwE
This can be done within a day, online and by phone. Costs anywhere between 200 and 500 EUR per year. Some insurers will tell you an EU driver's license is not enough, and you need a Spanish driver's license. This is BS, so safely ignore or go to a different insurer.

## Step 7: License Plates

Finally, go to a car mechanic shop and order your license plates. You will need the DGT permisso de circulacion with the registration number. This will take 1-2 days, costs about 20 EUR.

## Step 8: Deregstriation in Country of Origin

If you need to deregister your car in your home country, make preparations beforehand. Your home country papers will be retained by the DGT. Consider, e.g., changing to export license plates before you move here or similar. Within the EU, your home country *should* get notified and your car automatically deregistered but that often doesn't work as it should.

## Summary

This will take you about 6 weeks, it will cost you only about 250-300 EUR and your sanity.
Et voilà &mdash; your car is registered in Donostia in no time.
